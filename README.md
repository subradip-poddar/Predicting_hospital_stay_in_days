# Predicting_hospital_stay_in_days

These days optimal usage of resources has become the most necessary ingredient in the success of any organization in any field. Healthcare is no different in this aspect. Hospitals are a place where the degree of uncertainty is always high. This calls for a thorough process in place for determining how and when a patient can recover by his medical history, seriousness of illness, other financial constraints so that the priority hierarchy can be created so that patients who are seriously ill can be attended so that they can recover quickly. So, for this the stay of the patient in the hospital in days should be predicted so that the resources are used optimally.

The goal is to properly anticipate the length of stay for each patient on a case-by-case basis so that hospitals may allocate resources more efficiently and effectively.
